At first lets find out the condition for infinitely large answer. We can conclude after observation that if there is at least one `a` in string ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t)
 and ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\left|&space;t\right|\neq&space;1), where ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\left|&space;t\right|) is the size of
 ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?t), then the answer for this case is infinitely large. We can prove that.
