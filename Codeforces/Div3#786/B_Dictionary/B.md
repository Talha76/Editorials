If we observe the dictionary as described in the problem statement, we can easily find a pattern such that, for all possible strings ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.im
age?s) where ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?s_{0}&space;=&space;s_{1}), then the string is not included in the dictionary. Thus for each of the 26 letters in S<
sub>0</sub> we get 25 letters in S<sub>1</sub> which makes the total count of words in the dictionary ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?25&space;\times&space;26&sp
